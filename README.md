- 👋 Hi, I’m @bandarr
- 👀 I’m interested in: drilling the fundamentals and building things that interest me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript and Full Stack Web Development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects where my experience will help, and get feedback on things I'm working on that are new to me.
